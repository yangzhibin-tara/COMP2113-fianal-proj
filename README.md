# COMP2113-fianal-proj
## Create a readme.md file there in the repo, which should contain:
- A brief identification of the team members.
- A game description with basic game rules.
- A list of features / functions that you plan to implement, vis-a-vis each of the items 1 to 5 listed under coding requirements above.
## Code Requirement. Your implementation should encompass the following coding elements:
- Generation of random game sets or events
- Data structures for storing game status
- Dynamic memory management
- File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status)
- Program codes in multiple files
- Proper indentation and naming styles
- In-code documentation
## Team members: 
Chen Hui Jun (3035533367);
Yang Zhi Bin (3035447037).
## Basic game rules: 
the player explores the rooms and every time he enters the room, he may trigger some events or discover some items that will help to uncover the truth of the story.
## features & function:
- Players can input directions to decide which room they want to explore and input commands to react to the events triggered.
- Players can pick up items and store them in their inventory
- Some events are generated randomly.
- Multiple files are used, including the room, item inventory, player's action....
- we will use vector to store game status and update the status when triggering the event.
  - we will store status of player, inventory, rooms in seperate vector.
